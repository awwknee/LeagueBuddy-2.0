# LeagueBuddy
LeagueBuddy 2.0 is a new and improved account manager for [League of Legends](https://na.leagueoflegends.com). After many years of playing, it can become difficult to keep track of accounts players have and use. This program helps to aleviate that by creating a system to hold that information.

The update moves the language from C# to Javascript, and updated the technologies behind it to using Electron, which is what programs like Discord and Google Chrome use today. Still heavily a work in progress, but functional :D

## Setup
